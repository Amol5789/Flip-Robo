review,rating
"I bought this the day it launched. The very moment it was available for sale and got it at an affordable price of ₹14999, delivered the same day via Amazon Prime. Its been almost 15 days of heavy use nowWhat i liked:-Amoled screen is sharp and crisp at displaying. No faulty viewing angles. Drop notch is super stylish and gives a flagship look to the device. Videos can be cropped to fit by the finger pinching out action. i have never seen Adaptive Brightness work so well in any phone.-Fingerprint sensor is easy to reach at the back below the camera. Quick unlocking and Smart Unlock works well. Face unlock is accurate and works well too.-Quad Camera setup is one of the sleekest cameras and positioning looks fabulous. The camera is quick to focus, great depth, the 64MP produces sharp images with a focus on the smallest details too. It has features like Pro, Hyperlapse, SlowMo, SuperSlowMo, Panorama, Night mode, Macro (wide), Bixby Vision, AR emoji, Food, 4k video and so much more. The front camera is better than what it looks like. It has perfect positioning, quick to focus and great attention to detail too. Overall, the cameras themselves make this phone worth a buy. Not just better in this range of phones but also than most flagship phones in 40-50k range.-Android 10 & One UI2.1 are both very clean, precise and extremely easy to use. If you're on any os below 9, this will be a great upgrade.-The biggest reason i bought this was the 6000mAh monster battery, it is not surprising that they do deliver their promise in this case too. The battery does not exhaust easily. Being a heavy user this battery, after charged fully, lasts around 2.5 days for me. The 15W type C charger that comes in the box takes about an hour to charge it from 0 to 100%.-There is one external speaker towards the side of the charging port which produces clean and moderately loud sound. Dolby Atmos Sound is also an upgrade if you are looking for a surround sound experience. towards the other side of the charging port, you have a 3.5mm headphone jack.-The Samsung Exynos 9611 processor lives upto its name. It is faster than i had expected it to be. Also, there are separate slots for memory and 2 sim cards which is a major pro.-The phone in hand feels very light, despite its huge battery. The Ocean Blue colour looks sophisticated and might give the black variant competition.-The box has a 15W fast charger with cable, user manuals, ejection pin.What I didn't like-It might sound stupid but there is nothing that i did not like about the m31. Maybe they could have provided a headphone in the box but given the features of the phone at such a low price range, that is understandable. Other than that, the phone has delivered to all the claims that it made and I think it is one of the best phones i have owned so far. Great competition in this range. Highly Recommended.",5
"1) When touch to ear while speaking, sensor malfunctions and call hold automatically2) Weight is high3) Battery is good4) Not perfect on Airtel WiFi calling, call disconnects automatically even WiFi speed is high5) 64MP Camera expected best clarity considering high megapixel rating, but it is lower in picture clarity which expected from 64MP6) If more moisture on finger, Fingerprint sensor will not work7) Battery is Best8) Speed is Best9) Speaker Volume and clarity is Best10) For office user, this is good choice11) Internet speed, hot spot is Best12) Screen performance w.r.t. comfort for eyes is Best",4
"this product is good, its fingerprint sensor is quite good, initially i have doubt about its battery as per some of review, but after 1 month use i can definitely say battery is upto the mark..currently there is no lagging issue lets hope  in future it will continue...camera quality is good, but slow mlo feature during night has some light sensitivity issue, samsung sud work on it, some will cry foul about filter, but its samsung, so anyone hav to be adjusted wid it...some will give 5 star but to be honest its situationalnothing can be perfect so this phone is, but its value for money, its one of best model in samsung mid range till date..4 star would be perfect for this phone",4
"I am writing this review after 10 days.1.CAMERAI found the rare camera excellent. The photos speak for there selves but focus is not available in macro mode you have to make exact distance about 3cms to clearly have a nice shot, the night mode is very good. When you open Slow motion videos, you fell lag on the videos. I think it is a software problem because i have seen m30s capturing good slow motion videos by having exactly the same proccer, I hope samsung will solve this problem in future updates.when we came to the front camera, i think samsung tried to improve the front camera from m30s. It is very great but suffers a little at night time.2.BATTERYThe 6000mah battery on this device is excellent, it last easly 2 days with moderete users. And can last a full day with heavy users so no need to worry about the battery.3.DISPLAYPerfect, no problem with that.4.VALUE FOR MONEYthe best from devices in this price segment.5.FINGER PRINT AND FACE UNLOCKfinger print is fast and secure, i have no problem with that. Face unlock is very fast during a day. But doesn't work sometimes at night and artificial light sources.PROS1.BIG BATTERY2.AWESOME DISPLAY3.GREAT CAMERA4.FAST FINGER PRINT SCANNERCONS1.LACKS FOCUS ON THE MACRO MODE CAMERA2.THE PHONE HEATS SOMETIMES BUT MANAGABLE.3.FRONT CAMERA IS NOT SOO GOOD AT NIGHT TIME.3.FELLS A LAG ON SLOWMOTION VIDEOS",5
This is the best thing you can get in this price range & NOT at China made one.Good:- Android version gives Beautiful looks!- Display Blue light filter is amazing.- Performance is great with no heat or lag issues.- Battery is HUUGEEEE- Expandable memory is cool !! Anyways 128 GB storage is pretty good.- Both sim slots support LTE .. that’s amazing- Fast charging takes not more than 45 mins to charge full- Mobile speakers are at OHKAY!- Camera is amazing- Figure-print sensor response is quickNot So Good:- Not sleek .. but ok.Go for it without any doubt.,5
"Very bad product1. Mainly  network  problem2.  only one sim work ,3. speaker  not  work,4. Don't buy SUMSANG  M series  phone",3
"The Samsung M31 is a power packed performer not only among it's equivalent price range smartphones but comparative to all high end phones available in the market today.1. Overall Handling is quite satisfying. With an Amoled Screen and a good resolution perfect for binge watching. You can switch between Vivid and Natural colours though (don't know why it comes in vivid default).2. Has a 64 MP rear camera with ultra wide and depth however as anyone would have a nick for wanting the best, there still is room for improvement.3. Comes with Face recognition and Finger print scanner, however there is a fraction of a second's lag while unlocking the phone. Recognition does get better with more use.4. Has an inbuilt Optimiser in the UI with anti-theft features to clear up memory,check battery usage and scan through an inbuilt antivirus. So that is an addition, however a third party antivirus should still be used as back up.5. The smartphone boasts of a 6000mAH mega battery and it lives up to the figure with 9-10 hrs of battery if used continuously and upto 2 days with normal to minimal use(Frankly speaking I gifted the phone to my mother and was surprised to see it working at 28%, the day after it was charged..also it was charged in the evening around 5 pm...so still not 2 days). The Charger supports fast charging but I wouldn't compare it to One Plus' dash charging as it would take upto 150 mins to reach full charge on M31.Eventually I did want to buy one more for myself,but there already is one M31 in the family.A great buy.",5
"Lightweight design,64 megapixcel camra captures each and every detail of picture,live focus mode of camra is best for click pics,mega display screen will give awesome experience in watching movies,latest processor gives you a fast access . In recent time all the works and education went online. Fingerprint and face lock feature of this phone give you a secure feeling while doing office work.32 mp front camera will be very useful in online classes and meetings. Best phone in its renge. Must bye.and sorry to forget to mention its stylish look specialy ocean blue model.loved it",5
Great phone in the range of 15k ( or less with discount and offers). Samsung is one of oldest brands and with good quality phone. Finger print scanner is fine but it could be on screen for better experience. Phone hasy a humongous battery life which easily enough for 1n half day. Also the 4 rear camera has superb lense quality. Pictures look amazing and colour gamut is also perfect. Overall a great buy.,4
"For those who wish to have an awesome camera view, this mobile is the best. Unbeatable camera - 64mp back and 32mp front camera. Worth your money. First time while all apps are getting installed it gets heated up , but as you use you will not find the issue. Charging takes more time and battery standby is also good.",5
"In a sea of Xiaomi's and Oppo, Vivo's, this is one of the best phones in this price segment. The stunning AMOLED screen is enough to lure people in but some other great things are it's battery life and the smooth One UI. Samsung finally is making some good midrange phones.",5
Finger print scanner is the worst.It takes 40s to unlock or read...and the just the display takes 20s to turn on.The phone is getting slower day by day.I have filled just 72gb out of 128 and the phone already lags.It takes decades to get the phone charged.Only good thing is the amoled display and the Camera  .So again after another 3 months...after some few updates I guess the phone is lag free and the fingerprint scanner somewhat is better .,3
"I am not gaming or who always view online content so for me battery life is the more concerned.So my reviews after 3 weeks of uses.Pros1. Good battery life2. Camera is good but not up to the marks with same budgets mobiles.Cons :Big Zero for heating issue, seriously the handset I using is getting warm if we talk for 30-40 mins or watch any movie for same time.Haven't tested yet playing high graphics game. Due to heating issue will not suggest to buy this phone.",3
"Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) does not able to handle multi tasking. Had read good reviews in YouTube and others but personally speaking, it gave me disappointment as the movement you work on multiple application at a time mobile get auto restart and it also get heat real quick. Camera also a bit disappointing and bit slow if you go for other options for taking pictures.Overall not worth. This is the 3rd month I'm using this mobile and within 2 month it started giving me problem. Please do think more than 100 times to put money on this mobile.",2
"Wow!!It is a great purchase I have made during this dussera. Samsung M31 delivered as it is speicfied.Big kudos to the design and the security features it posses.The camera and finger print sensors are awesome and their functionality is epic.The 64MB picture quality sets benchmark in this category of mobiles.Screenshot function delivered  with across screen sweep , is like a magic wand touch which is creative and innovativeThe RAM and processor usage is very optimum to these category of mobiles.",5
"It's a real mega monster specially  in  this  price  range. I liked m31 very much because of its 64 mp quad camera 4k video recording ,the super amoled  FHD+infinity  u display with a big screen size of 6.4 inch also the fast charging  and long lasting  6000mAh battery ,and a good processor and a very quick working  face lock and fingerprint sensor, it is a product which is worth for the amount taken and it is the second time I bought it .An excellent value for money product",5
I m using Samsung for first time to support made in India and non Chinese phone. But astonished to see the quality which is marvelous. Super amoled screen is mind blowing. Camera is very good. Macro camera is also nice. Video calling experience is superb with 32 mp front camera. Sound is vibrant. Liked the quality very much. Watched 4k videos which is flawless. If anyone think to purchase then no second thought required. But cons is that a little costly. However after using I didn't regret its price.,5
"This is a good choice in the price range. Battery life is super and features are also good. Only drawback is the front camera quality.It had a phone freeze issue after April 2020 update, hope it is fixed now after the recent update. Not sure as I haven't witnessed it recently.Overall a good phone!",4
"Subject Heading- Phone was Automatically hang and switch off and Not open again.Now next day going to nearest service center in Deoria UP,( Hanuman Mandir Road), He was checking and saying It will take one week time to make. he gives the reason its ON/OFF circuit board is not working, and we will give the order to bring this part from our main center in Noida. Then that time i have no option and submitted my mobile for one week .My Question to #SamsungIndia, Why you are not remove the hanging problem , also why your service center  taking one week or more than one week time for little bit bug fixing . I am really irritate and to get worried.",1
"Got it during offer period....so far no issues faced....go for it if you get it cheap.Phone looks premium .Display, camera and audio are awesome. Battery life is very good as well.overall performance is good.the only con is the that if you watch youtube videos in portrait mode, the video size is smaller compared to the full phone size...looks wierd...but if you rotate it to full screen, its fine.",5
"I bought this phone around june.Within 4 months of  use it heavy dust got accumulated on one of the camera without any heavy use.That also without any heavy usage,it was laying on the table all day for that time.Thanks to lockdown !Highly disappointed with product manufacturers , adding 4 cameras comes with cost of servicing.i went to service center they said i have to pay this doesn't comes with IPS protection so doesn't cover in warranty..The material used on the back with camera casing is not of good quality anything xan easily pass in..",3
With this price it does not have compass to navigate which makes some apps unable to use. Like sky watch. So disappointing. Even smart phone which cost around rs.6000 does have it.,2
Battery backup is good. Screen size is good. But display is bad. While watching videos on YouTube it's horrible. And also speaker quality is bad,2
Ok,2
Poor carma,2
"Not a good product, touch is not smooth, camera quality is not 2 out of 5, heavy in weight, hanging problem",2
"I have taken mobile phone jst 4th month running, bt its very hard to work and also hang",2
Vest product only 25 days used so many problems west product,2
No warranty card inside. Product seems to be opened.,2
Worst camrea evrrr,2
"All are OK but,Fone is going to auto reboot mode",2
Basic product with average performance.Can be used for basic usage. Camera quality is really bad. Display is good.,2
I purchased for more battery backup but not in 95% charged lower in one day.Camera & screen is good. Redmi9 battery not good.,2
Hanging issue don't buy after using one month,2

It is in very small size but perfect for rough use. But u could choose better than it because it  has no mp3. Invest more 3-4 hundred bucks and buy samsung guru music or fmAfter using 12 months it became worst. Hanging issue/ voice not clear/ network issue/ So thown down in dustbinREAD MORE,3

"could've used invisible light, like so many other mice do now a days. it's accurate, a little too sensitive, as in, it'll work even if you're not completely touching the surface on which you've kept the mouse. so lifting the mouse a little to place it in a new place during gaming is a little tricky. build quality is good, scroll wheel is soft and has a nice click, size is comfortable.reducing stars because of low quality, fragile, thin wire.READ MORE",3

But it works perfectly with Mac OS Sierra. There is no such an issue in 2 weeks. I really appreciate HP for this budget USB mouse.

"The mouse is compact and seems to be genuine HP product. While ordering it was thought to be a standard full size mouse, but it was realized to be of compact size when the product was received. The mouse simply works plug-n-play in both Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux through its USB Type-A port. No issue was observed in the last few days. I am happy with the product. The mouse also looks good.READ MORE",5

"For the price, this is a fantastic small computer mouse. But for those rough usage, this won't last longer. I had different experiences on each time I purchased this. First time it was very robust and great, I used it for more than 3 years without any issue. But second time the wire was very weak and broken within 4 months. And the third time it's going good till now.READ MORE",4

I expected at least a decent mouse from hp at this price. My 3 year old chinese mouse that has a wobbly sensor is more responsive than this.

"The phone works just fine! Despite the negativity around the battery life (which is true, only if you want to want to play games).Camera is nice, display with True Tone feels just right and the performance is spectacular! After 3 years with Android (Google Pixel 2 XL) it was time to head back to iOS. Nothing against Android, that was a brilliant phone too, but too big for me. (Personal choice). I don’t play games or watch movies/videos for prolonged duration. So a big screen just felt like ...READ MORE",4
Performance is awesome with A13 bionic chipThose who capture a lot of pics it’s a very good choice fir them... single camera but picture quality is giant....Battery performance is little bit of weak.. doesn’t looks good.. for normal use it’s ok.. but those who are heavy user for them doesn’t look good....Very handy phone with a premium look... but the bazzels one the screen looks old.. but overall it’s good to buy within this price rangeREAD MORE,5
This phone is meant for niche market. Not for people who like screen size more than 5.5 or 6 inch. Was waiting for a product like this since long and now will experience this with the latest A13 bionic chip. Great buy for people who require smaller handy phones. Not for gaming purpose of course. You can buy a play station instead 😉. RegardsREAD MORE,4

It’s a great IPhone. Those who are using 6 and 6s should definitely upgrade. But those who are using 7 and above should not as 7 is still a fast phone and it will get atleast one more year of update. Coming to iPhone se it’s a great phone. Camera is great. Features are great. Battery is issue. It won’t last you whole day if your a heavy user. Expect 5 hours of screen time of your heavy user.

I edited this just after 3 months of use that the battery is so so bad that i had to refill it atleast twice a day and it takes more than 2 hours to refill. This mobile was great in terms of performance and camera but lacks a little bit on the design and battery. The design was bit outdated and the mobile takes more than 2 hours to refill. The IOS experience was great but i do prefer the android experience which is free and have more variety in it. In this price range the only competitors are...READ MORE,3

The adapter also heats up during charging.Apart from this and short battery life, everything else is satisfactory.READ MORE",3

Another issue of mine is transferring files between my iPhone and windows PC; it was much easier and faster with my android.READ MORE",5

Don't worry about what people keep saying about the battery and worry too much about the form factor. Just use it! Much better than androids in this price range. Smooth experience. No lags or stutters. Coming from android small software changes takes a small learning curve. where sometimes i feel android is a little more user friendly. but that's nitpickingI'...READ MORE,4

Best phone. Camera & overall performance is well. Also if you previously used some big screen mobile then it feels too small.But completely disappointed with battery performance. Mobile heats if you are watching videos on YouTube or some heavy app. Battery drains much fast. Also apple doesn’t provides fast charging adapter even after this phone supports fast charging. You have to charge it two or thrice in a day if you are spending more time on mobile. But at the end best budget iphone.READ MORE,5

I was using an iPhone 6 and don’t really wanted to upgrade due to the large size of phone. SE 2 is a decent upgrade as it’s a power packed version and feels like the same old iPhone 6 on hand. But strictly for normal usage.. Of one is glued to the phone kind then battery will be an issue. If ur usage is between 3 to 4 hours then it’s a good buy. Above all during the sale the price was a killer in Flipkart...and product was genuine...READ MORE,4

At the end I would like to say that if you want to switch from Android to IOS and you don't have a big budget then go for this phone you won't regret buying this machine.READ MORE,5

There’s no need for me to write anything about iphones. As expected performs really very well. Though the battery is a lot smaller. You need to charge quite often.

Overall it is good for a student like me although it may not be a good choice for a business man because of it’s small size of the battery which may drain quickly.

Got 128gb version on bbd sale at good price. Its like mini iphone 11. In camera only night mode is missing. Average battery back up. In box  Slow charger is a big con. But if you use it only for camera and normal phone use than it is really nice phone. Video recording is really great and stable . For gaming screen is little bit short but not too short for video watching. If you want an iPhone but budget is low than it is best choice under 30k.READ MORE,4

This was bought as an official phone. So this is not my primary phone. Build quality: Excellent and feels premium in hand especially in the RED colour. It is light and compact. SW and performance : once you update to iOS 14 it gives lot of additional features. Performance is excellent with A13 chip and the phone never stutters.Camera : Pretty good in daylight. Yet to test the low light performance. Video is very good as well. Battery : I have seen reviews that battery is not good. But for...READ MORE,5

The display is good and smooth to use( haven't used 90/120Hz display so can't compare and don't play games to feel lack of processing power if any).READ MORE",5

"A moderate user, need a compact and speedy device with continuous software updates. Then this is the phone you want. No compromise on quality and photography. I’m easily getting one day with single charge. One good thing with this phone is it is not at all discharging in idle state. Battery management is very good in this phone. Photos output is very good.

"The best phone for video. It records 4K at 60 FPS. And it makes a visible difference. When making videos with a lot of movement it shows how those 30 extra frames make a difference. The video is smoother and overall beats my Pixel 2 XL out of the water. At 26,999 it's very little phone for a lot of money. But I only bought it for video. And it does a better job than any other camera at this price. Will updREAD MORE",5

"Amazing phone. Average battery. Can survive for one day when used moderately. Heavy users cannot last for a day with this battery. Display is small, browsing and video and general experience will not be great if you are used to big screens. Trust me you cannot get over with these two - Battery and Display, no matter how many days you use it and think you will get used to it. I like small display and small sized phones so it suits me well.READ MORE",5

"First place, I love this phone. I have been using the iPhone 7 for about 3 years and so. This is an excellent product. I am very much concerned with the exchange process. They quoted me 8700 for my iPhone 7 128 GB, but while picking up my phone they checked everything and all was working fine only the outer sides of my phone had small dots which they classified as dents for no reason and asked me to pay 2700 extra from what I had actually paid.READ MORE",4

The poorest choice I have made to purchase an iPhone SE. There worst thing is its battery back up. It drains so fast even without any use.

There is no return or replacement facility for this phone as well.READ MORE,1

Product is good but the nature of delivery boy was not acceptable as he was made up with his mind that not to take the phone & to reject with one two minimal scratches & those because of cover as the condition of phone was superb as he knew it that we won't sent the phone back so he rejected the phone & told us to cancel the phone or to given the money instead rejecting phone so I was happy with the phone I just provided 5 star to it & will provide 1 star to the service & the delivery boy.READ MORE,5

"Battery is a big time issue in this one. Phone is not having many apps in it by default so you will have to install all by yourself. Bluetooth is active in my handset but sending and receiving files is not happening. File management is not good in this version as no file manager installed. Screen display is very small. No SD card slot. It says it’s dual SIM but second SIM has to be an e-SIM, doesn’t solve the purpose. Not having any great features. All in all okay okay product.READ MORE",2

Ausome Sound Bar....Loved It... But the Cons of this Sound bar is the sound just comes from Sound bar. The subwoofer only makes the base and other effects. But the vocals does not comes from the Sound bar. It means the Sound bar is of 60w. So the total vocal output of the whole is 60w. Otherwise the vocals are clear and rest is also very good. Ausome base is created by the sound bar.READ MORE,5

"Bass has to be kept at -5 for realistic audio. A little too much thump from the suboofer. Otherwise, it's all good. Surprisingly, the Bluetooth audio is louder and more clear than the optical & HDMI ARC connection. Also, the AUX connection has a continuous loud hissing noise in the background. All the time. Tried with different cables, same issue. Nothing major, but you should know.No idea about the durability and the longevity. I'll probably update in 6 months.READ MORE",3

In terms of home theater i tried mi soundbar, f&d t200x, zebronics 4.1 home theatre etc but all of them failed at certain level. Again i liked JBL soundbar.After reading so many positive reviews i took risk of purchasing Boat Aavante 2000, and i could certainly say it did not disappoint me.Generally i lik...READ MORE",5

I bought avante bar 2000 160 w. Here are some pros and cons..Pros1. Bass is bombastic.2. Treble is also good.3. Bass lover will love it.4. Bluetooth version is 5.0 previously it was 2.1 now the connectivity is better compare to 2.1Cons1. Too much bass overpowered sound.2. In movies dialogues sound is low but action scenes sound is loud. So you have to press remote regularly.READ MORE,5

"Signal drop in bluetooth connectivity, and distortion in audio. No HDMI ARC slot provision but coaxial input. Base effect was very poor. Garbage chinese waste. No replacement. Flipkart dont provide invoice. Flipkar seems to be in trouble. Will close down shortly? Dont buy from Flipkart. Customer support guys are joking. Installation person was a gourmut, no knowledge about sounbar.READ MORE",1
"I would Strongly suggest not to go with the soundbars of Boat, they are not of good quality. My boat Aavante 2000 stopped working after 5 months of purchase. The service of Boat is simply pathetic. You keep on writing email to them they will not respond, you keep call their customer support they will not provide you with any resolution. Its better to go with any brand other than Boat.READ MORE",1

I use it last 2 weeks. Sound quality is good. I use it for LED tv through digital optical cable. Sound is less on that mode When I use it on Bluetooth or HDMI sound is high vs optical cable.Bass is very high in my 12by12 room. I use bass -5  for general programs. It's value for money. I think it best in this price range. It not Dolby sound but bass lovers it is best.READ MORE,5

"I am writing this after using the product for about 1 week. People who have a good knowledge of sound,  would not really like the product because its bass is to tuned well with the bar. When you play movies, music etc the saturation of beats is very feeble. You only hear bass bass and bass. Its bass is good, no doubt about it, but it also interrupts the clarity of sound. I would recommend if Boat tunes the sound well with its bass instead of giving only bass.READ MORE",4

Where battery is used here?This is wrong question you are asking. But in this only the missing part is they are not providing cables to connect to TV . Optical and HDMI are we have to purchase separately.  Then only you will get the clarity of the sound while watching TV. If you are using only for music systems then bluetooth is enough.  Other than that everything is fine.READ MORE,5

The Base is outstanding but the Speaker are not up to the mark.As Company claim the speakers output as 80w but it feels as 30-35w.

The speaker has huge & crystal clear voice, and the look is so hot & attractive that this phone dominates in front of other high budget phones.As such all color varients are better, but I own the Emerald green varient which is the best, awesome & appreciated & praised by all, whoever see it.READ MORE",5

"HONEST REVIEW FROM A HONEST BUYER !I know there are lot of pros but one major con is making everything in this phone bad .i.e the processor. The phone is very slow--the fingerprint sensor, the application handling, the typing in keyboard. So overall if you are looking for a secondary phone only for calls then you can go for it otherwise in this range go for Asus who also has the same configuration in terms of battery and RAM but with a far fast processor .Black colour model is a big turno...READ MORE",2

"This MI smartphone at this price is incredible... The only con according to me what anybody would notice is the processor... so if you are looking for a strong gaming phone I would not recommend it.. Because it can give average to good performance in heavy games but not the best... so, if you are just looking for a quality smartphone with good performance .... just go for it blindly.READ MORE",5
